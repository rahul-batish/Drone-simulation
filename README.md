• Establish the Mathematical model and the Physics behind a four propeller 
drone modelled after the DJI Mavic Pro.

• Design a SIMULINK model simulating the complete dynamics of our drone as 
well as location and gusts.

• Design and implement a PID controller to control the position and attitude of 
our drone.
